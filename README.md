# text_editor
My attempt to make a text editor in C
This program only runs in Linux, I'm currently using WSL with an Ubuntu distro to control it and edit it in VSCode with CMake for the project build.
Not all features work exacty as they would in Linux, like the Ctrl. + V isn't truly disabled even after setting its flag off.
